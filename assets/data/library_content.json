        "featured": true,
        "content": "Ever feel like you need more to get the same vibe? That’s tolerance kicking in. When you regularly use cannabinoids like THC, HHC, or Delta-8, your brain’s CB₁ receptors adapt—they down-regulate (lose some ‘locks’) and desensitize (make the remaining ‘locks’ harder to turn). This natural homeostasis means the same dose yields less effect over time. A full **28-day break** lets your receptors reset, restoring sensitivity so you can enjoy smaller amounts for the same high."
